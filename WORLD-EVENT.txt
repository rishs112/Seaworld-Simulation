Created the Monster and Crab Interactions and made the classes and the animations of the different entities
Made the interactions of Monster creating a purple path in the virtual world and making the purple background barrier.

This event is triggered with a mouse click at any point in the Virtual World. The Monster moves once a Crab is created anywhere on 
world.

The Project is an improvement of the project provided in CPE 203. It follows Single Step Pathing Strategy. Once the Monster spawns with a click, it will
find the nearest Crab and travel towards it. While travelling, it leaves a purple goo that trails the Monster and becomes an impenetrable
barrier. One the Monster finds the Crab, they both fuse and transform into a Monster Seagrass. This particular Seagrass is mutated and
follows the similar things that Sgrasses do however fish are created at a rapid pace. This creates the chaos that is expected since
introducing a Monster creates too many unwanted things.

The affected entity is the crab and gets transformed into a Monster Seagrass. The entities should also not be able to pass through the purple barrier created by the Monster.

New entity that is created is the Monster Seagrass which spits out Fishes faster than Normal Seagrass. This ensures that there is a steady
cycle where not all the seagrass are destroyed. Furthermore, the Monster Seagrass is muutated and cannot be destroyed at all, even by 
Crabs. Therefore the Octopus can multiply and take care of the access of fishes that come by.

Unfixed - Entities still passing through Purple Background
